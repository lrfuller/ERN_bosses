## ERN Bosses: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the ERN Shield app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Lukas Fuller. The app provides information about the shields in elden ring nightreign in a simple way.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences and navigation state) created by you (the user) is stored locally on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the Android project directory.
